## Motivation

Martin's Movies is a coding challenge I did. \
Given a spec sheet, an API, and a similar website's theme, I was tasked with creating a comparable product. \
If you are a recruiter, please note that the dead links in the header and footer were part of the spec. \
The project's primary function is to showcase my proficiency with the technologies used within and doesn't represent an actual website.

## Technologies Utilized

* Javascript
* React
* Bootstrap
* Axios
* REST APIs
* CSS

## Features

Martin's Movies is a fast, fully searchable, cross-browser compatible movie database. \
It features over 8,000 top rated movies, and allows the user to mark which movies they've seen. \
It is fully paginated, and scales as more movies are added to the database. \
API calls leverage local caching to minimize data transfer from the server.
